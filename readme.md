This is my stream of consciousness coding as I read Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing In One Weekend.
I didn't try to copy Peter's code exactly, and that might produce subtly different images, but
I did write with the intent of generating the same pictures as in the book.

Who knows how it will turn out?! :-)
